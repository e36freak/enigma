# usage: enigma -- [OPTIONS] ROTOR1 ROTOR2 ROTOR3 REFLECTOR [FILE ...]
#
# the '--' is required, so AWK itself doesn't read the options
#
# Reads FILE(s), or the standard input if not provided, and encrypts or
# decrypts the contents in the same manor as an Enigma machine. 
#
#  Options:
#   -i, --initial CHARS   Set the rotors according to the initial setting in
#                         CHARS. CHARS is a three-letter string containing the
#                         letters that would be visible in the windows
#   -h, --help            Display this help and exit
#
# The ROTOR* and REFLECTOR files contain 26 lines of the format:
#   IN OUT [NOTCH]
# IN and OUT are letters, and NOTCH, if it exists, is a plus sign (+). For
# example, the line "a f +" would indicate that "a" is mapped to "f", and that
# the next rotor should step when on the "a". The "new_rotor" tool included in
# this repo will randomly generate rotors for you.


## usage: getopts(optstring [, longopt_array ])
## Parses options, and deletes them from ARGV. "optstring" is of the form
## "ab:c". Each letter is a possible option. If the letter is followed by a
## colon (:), then the option requires an argument. If an argument is not
## provided, or an invalid option is given, getopts will print the appropriate
## error message and return "?". Returns each option as it's read, and -1 when
## no options are left. "optind" will be set to the index of the next
## non-option argument when finished. "optarg" will be set to the option's
## argument, when provided. If not provided, "optarg" will be empty. "optname"
## will be set to the current option, as provided. Getopts will delete each
## option and argument that it successfully reads, so awk will be able to treat
## whatever's left as filenames/assignments, as usual. If provided,
## "longopt_array" is the name of an associative array that maps long options to
## the appropriate short option (do not include the hyphens on either).
## Sample usage can be found in the examples dir, with gawk extensions, or in
## the ogrep script for a POSIX example: https://github.com/e36freak/ogrep
